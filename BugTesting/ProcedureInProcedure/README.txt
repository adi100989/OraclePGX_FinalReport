#############   Procedure call inside a Procedure  ##########


1. calling ProcInProc2 which return the # nodes in graph G inside ProcInProc() . 

2. This gives an error. There is no documentation which exaplins this process. 
	Moreover how do we pass the node properties from one procedure to another. 
	This also gives me an error.

3. Now the solution can be that we can call two procedures inside the PGX java script and then assign values to variables.
