Code for Label Propagation and Girvan Newman Algos
This repository contains tested code for both the algos for the CSE523 submission
1. CSE 523 Project Final Report.pdf   => the final pdf file which contains the code and observatiuons and errors

2. Label Propagation Algorithm : 
  - label_propagation_proc.gm   => GreenMarl code which contains code for parallel implementation for label propagation . The algo is   present in the file itself
  - label_prop.py   => testing code for the above program but serially and using networkX library
  
3. Girvan Newman Algorithm :
  - girvan_newman.gm   => GreenMarl code which contains code for parallel implementation for community detection algorithm using edge betweeness .
  - GirvanNewmanUnmodularized.py  = >  testing code for the above program but serially and using networkX library
